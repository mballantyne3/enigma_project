Enigma Project Self Evaluation 

1. Functionality => Meets Expectations(3): Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented. Was not able to make it to the #crack method and wanted to focus on refactoring and functionality of other methods 
2. Object Oriented Programming => Above Expectations(4): Several modules are utilized to cut down on the Enigma class and relocate dependency requires to one module. 
3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics => Above Expectations(4): No method exceeds 10 lines, utilization of a new concept known as a "constant" for CHARACTER_SET was utilized to further cut down on code.  
4. Test Driven Development => Above Expectations(4): 100 % test coverage. Several mocks are also utilized for testing date, offset, and shift modules. 
5. Version Control => Meets Expectations(3.7): Approximately 40 commits done with 8 pull requests most of which demonstrate functionality of new code requesting a merge.
